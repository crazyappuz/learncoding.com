      Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
      executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or
      to perform a particular task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis,
      generating algorithms, profiling algorithms'
      , and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
      language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program
      written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers,
      rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
      processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of
      instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as
      complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given
      problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several
      different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
      specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Tasks accompanying and related
      to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
      implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such
      as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part
      of the programming process, but often the term software development is
      used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or
      coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering
      combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
      Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and
      programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.When referring to DNA
      transcription, the coding strand (or informational strand[1][2]) is the
      DNA strand whose base sequence is identical to the base sequence of the
      RNA transcript produced (although with thymine replaced by uracil). It is
      this strand which contains codons, while the non-coding strand contains
      anticodons. During transcription, RNA Pol II binds to the non-coding
      template strand, reads the anti-codons, and transcribes their sequence to
      synthesize an RNA transcript with complementary bases. By convention, the
      coding strand is the strand used when displaying a DNA sequence. It is
      presented in the 5' to 3' direction. Wherever a gene exists on a DNA
      molecule, one strand is the coding strand (or sense strand), and the other
      is the noncoding strand (also called the antisense strand,[3] anticoding
      strand, template strand or transcribed strand).Legal coding is the process
      of creating summary or keyword data from a document. It is widely used in
      the legal profession to create a fast-search index or database of
      documents for use in litigation. Objective Coding Definitions The
      recording of basic data such as date, author, or document type, from
      documents into a database. Extracting information from electronic
      documents such as date created, author recipient, CC and linking each
      image to the information in pre-defined objective fields. In direct
      opposition to Subjective Coding where legal interpretations of data in a
      document are linked to individual documents. Also called bibliographic
      coding. Extracting such information from a document as its author, its
      mailing date, etc. Objective coding is usually done from the document text
      or image, because the metadata may be inaccurate. For example, a document
      written and signed by a partner might show the administrative assistant as
      the author in the metadata, because it was originally typed on the
      assistantâ€™s computer.
